# Microsoft-Rewards-Automation
A program to automate web searches for quick Microsoft Rewards completion. (Both PC and ~Mobile~)

# Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Do not claim the rewards as soon as you reach them. At least for one week, continue with normal searching (this is my guess). Otherwise, you may risk a temporary ban.
-  Microsoft has been banning people who use VPNs to earn rewards from different countries, so be cautious. Also, do not use this method all day; **only use it on days when you feel lazy or when you don't have much time left**.
-  Feel free to suggest ways to improve this.


# Note
Before starting, make sure the delays correspond to the time it takes to perform specific actions on your PC. <Br> <Br>
