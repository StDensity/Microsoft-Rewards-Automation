# GUI_v1.6
In this version you don't have to worry about making the screen full screen or not. <Br>
Your Edge browser should be located at the following path: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe". <Br>
This path is the default for most PCs, so it should not be a problem. If it is not located there, you can edit the code accordingly. <Br>



# Version 1.0
# Important
⚠️ To ensure that this works, the browser window should be open in full screen. If it isn't in full screen, please maximize it. <Br>
⚠️ Your Edge browser should be located at the following path: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe". <Br>
This path is the default for most PCs, so it should not be a problem. If it is not located there, you can edit the code accordingly. <Br>

# How it works
It opens browser(if it isn't full screen make it before the code runs). Moves the mouse pointer to a coordinate of the search bar.
It is HARD CODED so if the screen size isn't the same then there will be an issue. <Br>
Then it searches randomly based on the limited data provided. It will be better if you create your own data for search. (Use chatGPT) <Br>
After 35 searches it will switch to mobile mode and does the search again. <Br>
Finally it opens the rewards page.

1. Use the GUI for easiest method.
2. Use auto_search_full_auto_toggle.py for non GUI method. It switches between PC and Mobile automatically.
3. auto_search_full_manual_toggle.py for non GUI manual PC and Mobile switch.
