# Microsoft-Rewards-Automation
A program to automate web searches for quick Microsoft Rewards completion. (Both PC and Mobile)


1. Use the GUI for easiest method.
2. Use auto_search_full_auto_toggle.py for non GUI method. It switches between PC and Mobile automatically.
3. auto_search_full_manual_toggle.py for non GUI manual PC and Mobile switch.

Bascally just use the 1 or second method. 
Any improvements or bugs, let me know. 
Good Day :)
