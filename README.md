# Microsoft-Rewards-Automation
A program to automate web searches for quick Microsoft Rewards completion. (Both PC and Mobile)

# Important
⚠️ To ensure that this works, the browser window should be open in full screen. If it isn't in full screen, please maximize it. <br>
⚠️ Your Edge browser should be located at the following path: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe". <br>
This path is the default for most PCs, so it should not be a problem. If it is not located there, you can edit the code accordingly.

1. Use the GUI for easiest method.
2. Use auto_search_full_auto_toggle.py for non GUI method. It switches between PC and Mobile automatically.
3. auto_search_full_manual_toggle.py for non GUI manual PC and Mobile switch.

Basically just use the first or second method. <br>
Any improvements or bugs, let me know. <br>
If you are new and don't know how to use it. let me know. <br> <br>
Good Day :)
